    <!-- tables are pretty much what you'd expect -->
    <!-- we lay out a row/column structure
        they're not great at laying out an overall webpage
        they're ARE great for laying out database information -->

    <!-- 
        the overall tag is table -> the entire table 
            thead -> the table header for a row
            tbody -> the main content of the table
            tfoot -> the footer row of the table

            within each:
                tr -> table row

                and within that:
                    th -> a table header cell (bold)
                    td -> a table data cell
        -->

    <!-- by default tables and cells will adjust their size to the content -->
