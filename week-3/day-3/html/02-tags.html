    <!-- for tags, there are 2 main distinctions:
            block vs inline
                block - automatically take up the available space left to right and push anything following it to the next line
                inline - takes up only as much as its contents and displays in line with other inline tags

            semantic vs generic
                there are many tags that do exactly the same thing but have different names. 
                    WHY? 
                    can be helpful for people uisng your site from a coding perspective to be able to understand what the intention of a certain section/tag is
                    also helpful for screen readers and accessability purpose

                    Generic Tags
                        block - div
                        inline - span

                    Semantic Tags
                        block with no formatting -> with no forheader, footer, nav, aside, section, etc.
                        block with formatting -> p, h1-h6, etc.

                        inline with no formatting -> n/a 
                        inline with formatting -> strong, em, a, etc.

                        there are also several other tags that dont really fall under these categories
                        like table, img, various form tags, etc.
